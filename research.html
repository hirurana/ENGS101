          <p class="lead" align="justify">
            Since the early days of communication, diplomats and military commanders understood that it was necessary to provide some mechanism to protect the confidentiality of correspondence and to have some means of detecting tampering. Julius Caesar is credited with the invention of the Caesar cipher c. 50 B.C., which was created to prevent his secret messages from being read should a message fall into the wrong hands, but for the most part protection was achieved through the application of procedural handling controls. Sensitive information was marked up to indicate that it should be protected and transported by trusted persons, guarded and stored in a secure environment or strong box. As postal services expanded, governments created official organizations to intercept, decipher, read and reseal letters (e.g. the UK Secret Office and Deciphering Branch in 1653). In the mid-19th century more complex classification systems were developed to allow governments to manage their information according to the degree of sensitivity. The British Government codified this, to some extent, with the publication of the Official Secrets Act in 1889. By the time of the First World War, multi-tier classification systems were used to communicate information to and from various fronts, which encouraged greater use of code making and breaking sections in diplomatic and military headquarters. In the United Kingdom this led to the creation of the Government Code and Cypher School in 1919. Encoding became more sophisticated between the wars as machines were employed to scramble and unscramble information. The volume of information shared by the Allied countries during the Second World War necessitated formal alignment of classification systems and procedural controls. An arcane range of markings evolved to indicate who could handle documents (usually officers rather than men) and where they should be stored as increasingly complex safes and storage facilities were developed. The Enigma Machine which was employed by the Germans to encrypt the data of warfare and successfully decrypted by Alan Turing can be regarded as a striking example of creating and using secured information. Procedures evolved to ensure documents were destroyed properly and it was the failure to follow these procedures which led to some of the greatest intelligence coups of the war (e.g. U-570). The end of the 20th century and early years of the 21st century saw rapid advancements in telecommunications, computing hardware and software, and data encryption. The availability of smaller, more powerful and less expensive computing equipment made electronic data processing within the reach of small business and the home user. These computers quickly became interconnected through the Internet. The rapid growth and widespread use of electronic data processing and electronic business conducted.

              <b>Unlike computer security</b>, information security handles both virtual and physical forms of information.
          </p>

          <p class="lead" align="justify">
            Notable examples---an ID card is a physical form of user information that could allow someone to impersonate an employee and gain access to sensitive company information. Meanwhile, email passwords and associated email accounts are the keys to receiving verification codes and can be used to compromise accounts linked to your email.

          <p class="lead" align="justify">
            As technology proliferates and computers are suddenly everywhere---in our phones, our cars, our home devices---the amount of information that can be gathered also increases. Naturally, as the breadth of information increases, so do the number of vulnerabilities. Professor George Danezis, the head of UCLâ€™s Information Security Group, discusses notable trends and other insights about his field, along with a five year outlook.

          <p class="lead" align="justify"><b>Social Engineering</b></p>

          <p class="lead" align="justify">In Season 3, Episode 3 of BBCâ€™s Sherlock, Sherlock Holmes uses social engineering in order to gather confidential information. Sherlock needed to break into a certain manâ€™s office, so he dated that manâ€™s secretary for a time and established a strong relationship with her. He eventually used that relationship to worm his way into the securely locked building and attempted to steal confidential computer files.
            <br><br>In the context of information security, social engineering is the act of manipulating human aspects of a system into giving access to sensitive information. Sherlockâ€™s move was planned very far ahead but many types of social engineering can be spontaneous and often rely on an abrupt effect. Other social engineering techniques include:</p>
