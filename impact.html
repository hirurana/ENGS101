      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Password Policies </h2>
      <br>
      <p class="lead" align="justify">Angela Sasse, director of the UK Research institute of Cyber Security and professor of Human-Centered
        security at UCL, changed the policy for the UK’s unified government password login criteria.</p>
      <p class="lead" align="justify">Looking at old password rules we see that it’s impossible to memorise 16 to 64 eight-digit codes and six-
        digit PINs that change monthly without writing them down. Therefor Sasse recommends that we should
        stop resetting our passwords so frequently. The problem is that this doesn’t take into account the
        inconvenience to users – the ‘usability costs’ – of forcing users to frequently change their passwords. The
        majority of password policies force us to use passwords that we find hard to remember.</p>
      <p class="lead" align="justify">Sasse concluded with four recommendations. First and most important, don’t waste people’s time and
        attention. Second, recognise that much security advice is paternalistic and not based on security that
        people want. Paternalism often masks incompetence, vested interests, and unwillingness to change. Finally
        giving up blaming users in favour of supporting them might bring real progress, but it requires a new and
        broader set of skills and a different mind-set and language.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Russian and Georgia war </h2>
        <br>
        <p class="lead" align="justify">During the war, hackers attacked the Georgian government’s news websites and disabled host servers. Some Russian news websites were also attacked. Some experts noted this as the first time in history that a notable cyberattack and an actual military engagement happened at the same time.</p>
        <p class="lead" align="justify">Weeks before the Russian invasion of Georgia, computers were already under attack. The website of the Georgian president was targeted which resulted in the site overloading. The site then was taken down for 24 hours.</p>
        <p class="lead" align="justify">Russian hackers also attacked the servers of the Azerbaijani “Day.Az” news agency. The reason being their position in covering the Russian-Georgian conflict. ANS.az, one of the leading news websites in Azerbaijan, was also attacked. Russian intelligence services had also disabled the Georgian information during the war. Despite these cyber-attacks, Georgian journalists managed to report on the war. Many media professionals and citizen journalists set up blogs to report or comment on the war.</p>
        <p class="lead" align="justify">The attacks involved Denial-of-service attacks, an form of attack where the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.</p>
        <p class="lead" align="justify">The Russian government denied the allegations that it were behind the attacks, saying that it was possible that "individuals in Russia or elsewhere had taken it upon themselves to start the attacks".</p>
