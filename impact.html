          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Password Policies </h2>
          <br>
          <p class="lead" align="justify">Angela Sasse, director of the UK Research institute of Cyber Security and professor of Human-Centered
            security at UCL, changed the policy for the UK’s unified government password login criteria.</p>
          <p class="lead" align="justify">Looking at old password rules we see that it’s impossible to memorise 16 to 64 eight-digit codes and six-
            digit PINs that change monthly without writing them down. Therefor Sasse recommends that we should
            stop resetting our passwords so frequently. The problem is that this doesn’t take into account the
            inconvenience to users – the ‘usability costs’ – of forcing users to frequently change their passwords. The
            majority of password policies force us to use passwords that we find hard to remember.</p>
            <p class="lead" align="justify">Sasse concluded with four recommendations. First and most important, don’t waste people’s time and
            attention. Second, recognise that much security advice is paternalistic and not based on security that
            people want. Paternalism often masks incompetence, vested interests, and unwillingness to change. Finally
            giving up blaming users in favour of supporting them might bring real progress, but it requires a new and
            broader set of skills and a different mind-set and language.</p>

          <br>
          <!-- <p class="lead" align="justify">The war was accompanied by a media battle between Russia and Georgia. The Russian military brought
            Russian journalists to the combat zone to report news discrediting Georgia and portraying Russia as the
            saviour of Russian citizens in the conflict zone. Russia also aired television footage supporting its actions
            which had a strong effect on the local populations of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. In a first for Russia, a
            Russian Armed Forces spokesman was provided by the Russian authorities to give television interviews
            about the war.</p> -->
            <p class="lead" align="justify">During the war, hackers attacked the Georgian government’s news websites and disabled host servers. Some Russian news websites were also attacked. Some experts noted this as the first time in history that a notable cyberattack and an actual military engagement happened at the same time.</p>
            <!-- <p class="lead" align="justify">Despite these tactics and domestic success, the Russian information campaign against
            Georgia was not successful internationally. In response to the information war, the Georgian government
            halted the broadcasting of Russian television channels in Georgia and blocked access to Russian websites.
            The information skirmishes between Georgia and Russia continued after armed hostilities had ended.
            According to political scientist Svante Cornell, the Kremlin spent millions in an international information
            campaign to blame Georgia for the war. Cornell writes that there is evidence, including some in Russian media,
            that Russia actually started the war.</p> -->
            <p class="lead" align="justify">Weeks before the Russian invasion of Georgia, computers were already under attack. The website of the Georgian president was targeted which resulted in the site overloading. The site then was taken down for 24 hours.</p>
            <p class="lead" align="justify">Russian hackers also attacked the servers of the Azerbaijani “Day.Az” news agency. The reason being their position in covering the Russian-Georgian conflict. ANS.az, one of the leading news websites in Azerbaijan, was also attacked. Russian intelligence services had also disabled the Georgian information during the war. Despite these cyber-attacks, Georgian journalists managed to report on the war. Many media professionals and citizen journalists set up blogs to report or comment on the war.</p>
            <p class="lead" align="justify">The attacks involved Denial-of-service attacks, an form of attack where the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.</p>
            <p class="lead" align="justify">The Russian government denied the allegations that it were behind the attacks, saying that it was possible that "individuals in Russia or elsewhere had taken it upon themselves to start the attacks".</p>
